rpi-autousbupload

Automatically uploads data from usb devices to an ftp server.
Just plug in any USB mass storage device (harddrives, usb-sticks, etc.) and it will automatically upload all files. It will also send an email on start and finish and show progress on a status website: ![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/xKxw1rE.png)

Originally written for [Lichtathleten](http://lichtathleten.com/) but relatively general purpose.

features
---
- scans for existing usb drives at boot and waits for new devices, uploads files on them to an ftp server
- sends a mail at beginning and finish or error of upload
- sends log messages to a log server on startup, beginning of upload, percentiles of upload and every 5 minutes
- automatically pulls from github repo on start

seems to need about 11MB of memory
